# Simple Interactive To-Do List Application

This project is a basic yet fully functional web-based To-Do List application. It allows users to efficiently manage their daily tasks, demonstrating core front-end development principles and client-side data persistence.

## Features

  * Add Tasks: Easily add new tasks to your list via an input field and button (or by pressing Enter).
  * Mark as Complete: Click on a task's text to toggle its completion status, visually indicated by a strikethrough.
  * Delete Tasks: Remove individual tasks from the list with a dedicated delete button.
  * Persistent Storage: All tasks are automatically saved to the browser's local storage, ensuring your list remains intact even after closing or refreshing the browser.
  * Responsive Design: A clean and simple user interface designed to be user-friendly.

## Technologies Used

  * HTML5: For the basic structure and content of the web page.
  * CSS3: For styling the application, providing a clean and intuitive user interface.
  * JavaScript (ES6+): For all interactive functionalities, including task management and local storage operations.

## How to Run Locally

1.  Clone the repository (if it were in GitHub, for now, just create the files):
    
    # If you had a repo, you'd do: git clone <repository-url>
    # For now, simply create a folder on your computer, e.g., 'todo-app'
    
2.  Navigate into the project directory:
    
    # cd todo-app
    
3.  Open index.html: Simply open the `index.html` file in your preferred web browser (e.g., Google Chrome, Firefox).

The application will load in your browser, ready for use\!
